This `Good Work License` (GWL), established by `Trin.Link` and written/maintained by `Jost Grant` (legal name, `Joshua Steven Grant`), is a legal instrument intended to govern the use and distribution of software and related materials within a 'Christian tech movement' framework. Notably the establishment of `PrayerWare` as a concept and a `Copyrite` system. This License is a living document and is recommended at this point only for personal, internal use by Jost Grant until version 1.x. And as-such will be very restrictive to assign full rights soley to him, to discourage outside use.
